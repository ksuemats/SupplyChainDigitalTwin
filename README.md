# Supply Chain Digital Twin with AI-Driven Insights

Welcome to the future of supply chain management! This project is a hackathon prototype designed to revolutionize how we model, analyze, and optimize supply chains through the power of digital twinning and AI. Our goal is to empower organizations to predict disruptions, streamline logistics, and make data-driven decisions in real time.

## Overview

In today’s fast-paced world, supply chain resilience is more important than ever. Our digital twin creates a dynamic, virtual replica of your supply chain network—simulating operations, processing real-time data, and leveraging OpenAI's GPT to generate actionable insights. This project is a testament to innovation under pressure and showcases how cutting-edge technology can transform complex challenges into opportunities for growth.
